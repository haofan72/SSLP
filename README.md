# Semi-supervised Label Propagation(SSLP)
This is the avaiable code for the paper ["Semi-supervised Label Propagation for Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Images Change Detection"]. It presents a semi-supervised Label Propagation approach (SSLP) for heterogeneous remote sensing images change detection.
## Requirements
It just use some common python dependencies.

## To start
The file `SSLP.py` is the entrance to the framework algorithm of this paper.

## Evaluation code
Evaluation code is `CDTool.py`,which will be called in `SSLP.py`.

## Data set description
The data set used is saved in folder `data` and the weak prior knowledge is saved as 'xx.py ' file.
